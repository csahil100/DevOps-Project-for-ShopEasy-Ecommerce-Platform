Microservices Design
Breaking down the backend into specific microservices was primarily driven by the desire to achieve modularity, scalability, and maintainability, aligned with the core principles of microservices architecture. Here's a detailed breakdown:

Modularity & Domain-Driven Design: By aligning each microservice with a distinct business capability (e.g., user management, product catalog, order processing), we followed a domain-driven design. This approach ensures that each service is modular and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

Scalability: E-commerce platforms, like "ShopEasy," often experience variable loads. For instance, during sale events or promotional campaigns, certain services (like order processing and product catalog) might experience a sudden surge in traffic. With a microservices setup, we can individually scale the services that are under high demand, without unnecessarily scaling others, leading to cost efficiency and performance optimization.

Ease of Maintenance and Continuous Deployment: Given that each microservice encapsulates a specific business function, teams can update, maintain, and deploy each service independently without affecting the others. This independence significantly reduces the coordination overhead among teams and allows for faster time-to-market for new features or updates.

Fault Isolation: In a monolithic setup, a failure in one component might bring down the entire system. But with our microservices architecture, if, for example, the feedback collection system encounters an issue, it won't impact the user's ability to browse products or process orders. This separation ensures higher availability and a better user experience.

Flexibility in Technology Stack: Each microservice can be developed using a technology stack best suited for its functionality. For instance, while Python was our primary language for service development, if we needed a microservice that required high-performance computations, we could have used a language like Go or Rust without impacting the other services.

Easier Debugging & Monitoring: With smaller, focused services, pinpointing errors, and debugging becomes more straightforward. It's easier to monitor specific metrics relevant to a service, optimizing performance and user experience.
